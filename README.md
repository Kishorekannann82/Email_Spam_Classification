# ðŸ“§ Email Spam Classification using Logistic Regression

This project is a Machine Learning application that classifies emails as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using **Logistic Regression**. It uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert raw email text into numerical features that can be used by a machine learning model.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

- **Preprocessing:** Text data is cleaned and vectorized using `TfidfVectorizer`.
- **Model Training:** A `LogisticRegression` model is trained on labeled email data.
- **Evaluation:** The model is tested on unseen data and evaluated using accuracy score.
